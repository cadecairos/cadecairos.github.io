        <section class="post-content">
            <!--kg-card-begin: markdown--><p>Over the past 2 months, the <a href="http://mozillapopcorn.org/?ref=chrisdecairos.ca">Popcorn Maker</a> team has been working really hard to develop new and exciting features for the app. Recently part of this work has involved trying out an <a href="https://developers.google.com/youtube/youtube_upload_widget?ref=chrisdecairos.ca">experimental feature from YouTube</a> that lets a user record a video from their webcam and upload it to their YouTube account. We have often thought about how awesome it would be to be able to record a video in the app and have it ready to popcorn-ize in minutes. With the YouTube iframe Uploading API, we can easily make that vision a reality. Today we're releasing it for testing in order to see how the tool performs.</p>
<p>This post will show you how you can use the new feature to upload a video directly to YouTube and have it put right into Popcorn Maker.</p>
<p><strong>Before I begin, there's a few details that need to be mentioned about the YouTube Uploader</strong></p>
<p>Firstly, you will need to have a Google account to use the tool, and you will be required to sign in (more on that later). You will also be required to have an up to date version of flash installed.</p>
<p>Secondly, this is an experimental API from Google, and it's feature-set is lacking. Because of this, videos you create cannot have any custom title or tags associated with them (yet). To better protect your privacy, we tell YouTube to mark all video's uploaded through the tool as &quot;Unlisted&quot;, so that they won't show up in any search results.</p>
<p>Lastly, the YouTube Uploading API is marked as an experimental feature, meaning <strong>Google can deprecate the service at any time</strong>. While we hope that never happens, it's important for you to understand that if they do deprecate the tool, we will be forced to deprecate the feature from Popcorn Maker.</p>
<p>With that said, lets look at how you can use the uploader in Popcorn Maker.</p>
