<p><strong>Bug 715323</strong> <strong>- nsBuiltinDecoderReader::NotifyDataArrived() should have a 64bit offset parameter</strong></p>
<p>This was an easy bug to work on. All that was needed was a change of type for a parameter in the NotifyDataArrived method.  It used to accept an unsigned 32 bit integer, which was sufficient, but limited the offset length to (2^32)-1 bytes. Sounds like a lot to me, but I imagine there are people out there who will hit that limit. I went ahead and changed the value to an unsigned 64 bit integer, which worked great.  After a review, Chris Pearce requested that I change it to a signed 64 bit integer because there could have been a case where a -1 could be used to indicate a failure. Easy change to make, now the change has been pulled into mozilla-central.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Bug 517363 - Preserve video poster aspect ratio when scaling</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: center;">This bug proved itself to be exponentially more trivial than I had first expected. In a nutshell, if you create a video element that is 500x500 in size, and have a video that is 640x480, Firefox will preserve the aspect ratio of the video within the border of the video element. If that video has a poster frame image that's also 640x480, Firefox will stretch and skew it to fit within the video element. Here's what that looks like: <a href="https://chrisdecairos.ca/content/images/2012/02/stretched-e1328824482105.png"><img class="aligncenter  wp-image-164" title="stretched" src="https://chrisdecairos.ca/content/images/2012/02/stretched-e1328824482105.png" alt width="440" height="120"></a>The poster is clearly stretched out.  This bug requested a fix so that the poster image is scaled to maintain it's original aspect ratio when it is placed within video elements.</p>
My first order of business figuring this one out was discovering where the poster was being painted to the element. A quick search in MXR for "poster frame" led me to nsVideoFrame.cpp. Aside from all the code in there I did not understand, one thing stood out, and that was <a href="http://mxr.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/source/layout/generic/nsVideoFrame.cpp?ref=chrisdecairos.ca#286">this line.</a> It looked like it was setting the height and width to draw the poster image. I commented it out and tested it, and found that it did indeed specify the size of the image.
<p>I was now faced with a problem. I had no information about the image, or the size of the video element. I didn't even know how to scale this properly. What I did know was that every frame of the video was scaled in some way. quickly scanning through the file led me to a fairly obvious method called CorrectForAspectRatio, that from what I could tell, calculated the right width, height and position to draw the video frames within the element. Over the next several days, I hacked different things into the code to try and find the right solution but ended up with nothing solid.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">Then, a couple days ago, I was driving home from Seneca, and The solution came to me. I needed to get references to the poster frame's anonymous image element and get a reference to the video element's dimensions, then do similar calculations to CorrectForAspectRatio. The key to getting the elements' information was do_QueryInterface, a magical method that gets me a reference to a type that isn't necessarily defined or in scope at runtime. (at least I *think* that's what it does). Once I had the code I beleived would scale the poster, I realized I needed code to ensure it was centered in the video element horizontally and vertically. Easy stuff, (N1 / 2) - (N2 / 2) did the trick easily.  Here's what things look like after my patch:<a href="https://chrisdecairos.ca/content/images/2012/02/Screenshot-at-2012-02-09-191840.png"><img class="aligncenter  wp-image-166" title="Corrected Image" src="https://chrisdecairos.ca/content/images/2012/02/Screenshot-at-2012-02-09-191840-e1328833518860.png" alt width="447" height="114"></a></p>
Both of these show unusual widths, so here is what it looked like with large heights and small widths:
<p><a href="https://chrisdecairos.ca/content/images/2012/02/stretch-vertical.png"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-167" title="stretch-vertical" src="https://chrisdecairos.ca/content/images/2012/02/stretch-vertical-e1328833974310.png" alt width="153" height="643"></a><a href="https://chrisdecairos.ca/content/images/2012/02/corrected-vertical.png"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-168" title="corrected-vertical" src="https://chrisdecairos.ca/content/images/2012/02/corrected-vertical-e1328834044679.png" alt width="148" height="624"></a></p>

<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p>So that works quite nicely. Only problem, is that my hack is ugly and needs a lot of work yet. But at least it works. I've submitted the patch for feedback <a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/attachment.cgi?id=595655&action=diff&ref=chrisdecairos.ca">here</a></p>
<p>Keep on Hacking!</p>
