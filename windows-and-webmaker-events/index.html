        <h1 class="post-title">Windows And Webmaker Events</h1>

        <section class="post-content">
            <!--kg-card-begin: markdown--><p>Webmaker is a very large project, with dozens of parts that all come together at <a href="https://webmaker.org/?ref=chrisdecairos.ca">https://webmaker.org</a>. One of the hardest things for new contributors is getting everything set up properly. This problem multiplies ten-fold when the desired platform of the developer is Windows. Recently, I put together a guide for a new contributor, explaining the steps it takes to set up a Windows 7 computer for development of Webmaker projects (specifically, the events platform). It's a long, complicated, and frustrating process, which I'd like to share here, so that should anyone need to do this, they won't have to look very far.</p>
<h2 id="dependencyinstallation">Dependency Installation</h2>
<h4 id="git">Git</h4>
<p>We use <a href="http://git-scm.com/?ref=chrisdecairos.ca">Git</a> for version control, and <a href="http://github.com/?ref=chrisdecairos.ca">Github</a> for hosting our code repos publicly.</p>
<p>You can install Git from <a href="http://git-scm.com/download/win?ref=chrisdecairos.ca">http://git-scm.com/download/win</a>. That site should automatically prompt you to download the latest version of Git available for Windows. Once it is downloaded, run the executable to begin the installation. I used all the default settings.</p>
<h4 id="node">Node</h4>
<p>Basically all of Webmakers servers are written in JavaScript, and use <a href="http://nodejs.org/?ref=chrisdecairos.ca">NodeJS</a>.</p>
<p>Download the latest installation executable from <a href="http://nodejs.org/download?ref=chrisdecairos.ca">http://nodejs.org/download</a> and run the installer once the download completes. Node Package Manager (npm) will be installed as well.</p>
<h4 id="python">Python</h4>
<p>Some modules included as dependencies will require Python 2.7 to be installed.</p>
<p>You can download the installer from <a href="https://www.python.org/download/releases/2.7.8/?ref=chrisdecairos.ca">https://www.python.org/download/releases/2.7.8/</a>. During the installation make sure to specify that you want python.exe added to your PATH.</p>
<h4 id="visualstudio2010">Visual Studio 2010</h4>
<p>This is where things get stupid. Npm depends on something called node-gyp, a so-called &quot;cross-platform&quot; tool for compiling native addons. The problem is, its a pain in the ass to get it running on a Windows machine. I'll share what I did to get it running, but in the end, you might have to do something different, depending on your machine.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>First, I installed Visual C++ 2010 Express from <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/visualstudio/eng/downloads?ref=chrisdecairos.ca#d-2010-express">microsoft.com</a>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I then installed the <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=8279&ref=chrisdecairos.ca">Windows SDK 7.1</a></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Next up was <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=23691&ref=chrisdecairos.ca">SP1 for Visual Studio 2010</a></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Lastly, I installed the <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=4422&ref=chrisdecairos.ca">Visual C++ 2010 SP1 Compiler Update for the Windows SDK 7.1</a></p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Installing the four items above didn't quite cut it for me though. Here's the last few steps I took:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>I ran git bash (you can find it in your start menu) and ran the command <code>npm install -g node-gyp</code> to install the node-gyp package globally.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I then opened the file <code>C:\Users\cade\.node-gyp\0.10.29 \common.gypi</code> - obviously, substitute your username and the version of node-gyp you install.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The file contains configuration settings in JSON format. Navigate to <code>target_defaults.msvs_settings.VCLinkerTool</code> and add <code>'AdditionalLibraryDirectories': 'c:\\Program Files\\Microsoft SDKs\\Windows\\v7.1\\Lib\\x64',</code> to the object <code>VCLinkerTool</code></p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>If you're as lucky as I was, node-gyp might now work for you!</p>
<h4 id="gruntcliandbower">Grunt-cli and bower</h4>
<p><a href="http://gruntjs.com/?ref=chrisdecairos.ca">Grunt</a> is a task runner, used maily for building resources. <a href="http://bower.io/?ref=chrisdecairos.ca">Bower</a> is a front-end package manager. We're going to install these globally using npm, so that the <code>grunt</code> and <code>bower</code> commands will be added to your PATH, making life easier. To do this run: <code>npm install -g grunt-cli bower</code></p>
<h2 id="settingupwebmakerevents">Setting up Webmaker Events</h2>
<h4 id="loginwebmakerorg">Login.webmaker.org</h4>
<p>This is the Login server for webmaker. It manages Webmaker accounts through the Login API, and is required for log-in functionality to work. The code can be found at <a href="https://github.com/mozilla/login.webmaker.org?ref=chrisdecairos.ca">https://github.com/mozilla/login.webmaker.org</a></p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>In Git Bash, change into the directory you would like to clone the code into.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Run <code>git clone https://github.com/your_user_name/login.webmaker.org</code> to clone your fork of the code to your machine. Git will set your Github fork up as the remote named &quot;origin&quot;, so you can push code changes and branches back up to the website.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Change into the login.webmaker.org folder and run <code>cp env.sample .env</code>. This will create a configuration file for the server from the default one provided in the repo. It's configured to work &quot;out of the box&quot; with other Webmaker sites and services you will run locally.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Now we need to install npm and bower dependencies. Do this by running <code>npm install; bower install</code></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You should now be able to start the server with <code>node app</code>. If Windows prompts you to grant permissions for Node, accept them.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h4 id="eventsfrontend">Events Front End</h4>
<p>This is the Front-End for The Webmaker Events platform. It's an Angular app that is served using Express. The source code is at <a href="https://github.com/mozilla/webmaker-events-2?ref=chrisdecairos.ca">https://github.com/mozilla/webmaker-events-2</a>. Don't ask about webmaker-events, we don't talk about it anymore.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>In Git Bash, change into the directory you would like to clone the code into.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Run <code>git clone https://github.com/your_user_name/webmaker-events-2</code> to clone your fork of the code to your machine. Git will set your Github fork up as the remote named &quot;origin&quot;, so you can push code changes and branches back up to the website.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Change into the webmaker-events-2 folder and run <code>cp .env-dist .env</code>. This will create a configuration file for the server from the default one provided in the repo. It's configured to work &quot;out of the box&quot; with other Webmaker sites and services you will run locally.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Now we need to install npm and bower dependencies. Do this by running <code>npm install; bower install</code></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Before we can run the server we need to compile the CSS. Do so by running <code>grunt build</code></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You should now be able to start the server with <code>node server/server.js</code>. If Windows prompts you to grant permissions for Node, accept them.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h4 id="eventsservice">Events Service</h4>
<p>This is the Events API, which provides RESTful read/write access to the events database. The source code can be found at <a href="https://github.com/mozilla/webmaker-events-service?ref=chrisdecairos.ca">https://github.com/mozilla/webmaker-events-service</a>.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>In Git Bash, change into the directory you would like to clone the code into.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Run <code>git clone https://github.com/your_user_name/webmaker-events-service</code> to clone your fork of the code to your machine. Git will set your Github fork up as the remote named &quot;origin&quot;, so you can push code changes and branches back up to the website.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Change into the webmaker-events-service folder and run <code>cp .env-dist .env</code>. This will create a configuration file for the server from the default one provided in the repo. It's configured to work &quot;out of the box&quot; with other Webmaker sites and services you will run locally.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Now we need to install the npm dependencies. Do this by running <code>npm install</code></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You should now be able to start the server with <code>node server/server.js</code>. If Windows prompts you to grant permissions for Node, accept them.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="summary">Summary</h2>
<p>Developing on windows with NPM <em><strong>sucks</strong></em>, but it's not impossible. If the above helped, I'm glad. The steps for the above set-ups for login, events and the events-service can be applied to most other Webmaker sites and tools. Be sure to always check the README files for details about set-up and running a particular project.</p>
