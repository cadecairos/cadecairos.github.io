            <!--kg-card-begin: markdown--><p>On Friday last week, I took ownership of a ticket that had been in limbo since late march.  The ticket asked for a Processing.js plug-in for the Popcorn.js library.  This sounded like a cool idea, so I was pretty excited to get the plug-in ready for review.</p>
<p>From what I saw in <a href="https://webmademovies.lighthouseapp.com/projects/63272/tickets/283-creat-a-processingjs-plugin?ref=chrisdecairos.ca">the ticket</a>, there was a lot of back and forth on this, and there was already code to work with. Sounds great right? Then I looked at <a href="https://github.com/ben1amin/popcorn-js/blob/0.5/plugins/processing/popcorn.processing.js?ref=chrisdecairos.ca">the code</a>... now, I'm not saying its terrible.. but it is riddled with flaws.  None of the code conforms to the <a href="https://webmademovies.lighthouseapp.com/projects/63272/styleguide?ref=chrisdecairos.ca">Popcorn style guide</a>. It used custom script fetching methods instead of using the tools provided by Popcorn. And it interacted in an inefficient manner with the Processing API.</p>
<p>Another major issue, was that it worked <em>backwards</em>.. &quot;Backwards?&quot;, you might ask... well, yes. Where the common consensus is that &quot;_start&quot; defines the beginning of something and &quot;_end&quot; defines when it disappears in Popcorn... this plug-in decided the times between start and end should define when it <em>does</em> <em>not </em>play.  All these things combined pretty much had me realize that this wasn't going to be easy.  A major re-write was in order.  Now not ALL of this code was unusable and I managed to salvage some of it so that I didn't have to start from scratch.</p>
<p><a href="http://scotland.proximity.on.ca/cadecairos/popcorn-js/processing/plugins/processing/popcorn.processing.html?ref=chrisdecairos.ca">Here's a small demo</a> to show that it's functional, and working like a charm :3</p>
<p>Next steps: Unit tests, and the peer reviews.</p>
