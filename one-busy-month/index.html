<p>At the beginning of September, Jon Buckley ( A.K.A. &quot;The Git Master&quot; ) had to bow out of his responsibilities as the manager of the repository. I was asked to take up the role, which to be honest is a huge responsibility that I do not take lightly. I still have lots to learn about doing things the proper way but that's what I'm here for. I have made a few mistakes (nothing too bad), but they are mistakes I won't make again. Coming next week I'll be responsible for tagging the 0.9 release and pushing the latest version out to the net!</p>
<p>Next week several of us here will be heading to CBC in Toronto to do some popcorn hacking! We are going to be assisting in creating Popcorn-Powered web tributes to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marshall_McLuhan?ref=chrisdecairos.ca" target="_blank">Marshall McLuhan</a>, that are to be hosted on the<a href="http://www.cbc.ca/toronto/?ref=chrisdecairos.ca" target="_blank"> CBC website</a>. This is something I'm really looking forward to, because it's not everyday you get the opportunity to work with such a large, public facing organization, with the possibility of your work getting national promotion!</p>
<p>Other than that every day has consisted of tickets. Tickets for breakfast, tickets for lunch, and a light afternoon snack of ticket reviews. yum :D.</p>
<p>See you next week, internetz!</p>
